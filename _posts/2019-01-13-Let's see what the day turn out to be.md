###Confused between different plans
I had to spend a day and my course of machine-learning that is lagging will be completed. But I will move with web development and today I will get my first certification at any cost. Also, today I will be completing first Javascript module.
So let's see how it goes.



#####12:52pm

Started doing python tutorials.


#####22.00pm

Started doing STL. Will be completing it today. Instead of using iterator in vector<int>::iterator,we can also use auto keyword. The only difference is that it will not be const iterator but a simple iterator.

Started working on Octave for ML course. I am too late for my plans but I amm working to make learn things and understand better. So no worries.

Some of the topics I have to read about are multilibraries but for now I will focus on Data Structures through C. Later I will be making a Physics Engine in C and also in C++ by implementing multithreading. So this goes noted. 

###### Octave Tricks! xD
Always use built in functions for string comparisions. Using strcmp() in Octave is preferred over == as == works on comparing every character one by one and thus returns error oncer different strings are encountered.
Octave is a very high level language understanding everything as a friend. :P

I believe that the way a computer engineer spends his summer most effectively affects his interests and fur to their future. Maybe, that is how Indian education works. Oka, so now that I have been selected in IIT ROPAR research internship, I have to complete Machine Learning course and that is the next thing that I am going to do and one thing that I am presently lagging is the way my confidence is working. I am thinking Machine Learning very hard, when infact I have not started it with that power. Enough for today's blog, I would try to amintain blog daily and continue with the plans of Completing basic Competitive Coding, and Machine Learning. In the next semester, I have to do competitive coding and that is for sure. I will try every possible way to crack ICPC this year. 
Currently reading *Master's Algorithm*. Let us see how this book will turn up to be.

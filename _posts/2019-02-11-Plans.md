I am really a noob when the fact is considered that I have spent almost two years in college and yet nothing much is achieved. But I have learnt that there is never late to atleast start. So, here I am giving that necessary push and contributions and efforts from my side. Will be completing JS textbook and some important AJAX and JQUERY from resources as quickly as possible. So tomorrow I will be kickstarting #100DaysOfCode in which I plan to learn complete web development, python, c++, practicing competitive coding, improve my algorithmic thinking. Also some of the efforts will be spent in GUI in TKinter along with some of the projects on machine learning through python and R and tools that will be used in machine learning in future projects.

``` October 2018 ```


I am at home and I do not want to waste this time like I did in my summer holidays and also I want to complete my left out plans like Machine Learning. So for this,

   * Machine Learning
   * Data Structures
   * Megachessatron and Game Of life
   
Then as I am lagging in daily studies so till 31st october I'll be completing 

   * Complete academics
   * Try to read STL and daily complete two coding problems and also push them on you github so as to make it greener.
   * Machine Learning
   * Data structures

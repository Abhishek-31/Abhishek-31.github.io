Boring exams
====

It has been a while since I have coded something, I guess a lot of time is gone in these exams. I can't figure out what is the need of these exams for which we just "waste" ample amoungt of time. Well this is it. I should not regret of these things.

Plans for December'2018

Yes I am en engineer and thus a procrastinator. If I remember the resolutions I made to myself some months back :P , I become speechless.
But still as a believe in hard work and that according to me nothing could beat hard work. Here I am presenting myself with another bunch of plans. 

First Week:
======
Complete Machine Learning course

Second Week:
======
Complete Frontend Development

Third Week:
======
Complete Javascript Data structures and Algorithms

Let's get to work. I need to finish this, this year and then only I can learn data structures and algorithms in next semester.
All the best!

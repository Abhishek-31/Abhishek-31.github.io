# Study Days

Well, as exams are apporaching so we have to study all the subjects religioulsy. First in the list is ofcourse Theory of Computation. So let us give it a start Target for completing it is 4pm. From 4 to 5, Computer organization should be done fifth chapter. After this till dinner, I have to complete Control Unit chapter and after it till sleeping, I have to complete practical and viva preparation of COmputer Organization.
Only 11 pages is not a big stuff for chapter four and so I would be working for both of the chapters in those two hours and that would be helping me. Giving this a start

### 13:19

Started wth formal languages. Lectures by Sanchit Jain are to be seen.
The portion of grammars was pretty easy. Going on the copy maintained in class.
I have planned to complete TOC and that too in a best possible way. Till night I will be completing TOC and then I would continue doing Computer Organization. In the morning- "GOT". I have challenged myself that until I will complete TOC, Computer Organization Chapter 4,5 and the experiments, I will not watch the series. This means that it is possible that in the night I will not take sleep.

title: Completing JS Modules

### Javascript and frontend 
I have to stick to my daily goals so as to achieve my final goal and I have to complete that list of checkpoints.

Not much to write in c/log of today but have to maintain daily github streak so here I am. Read about a new concept in Javascript that is known as ***Type Coercion*** and which means that whenever the values are compared then at that time type conversion takes place in which the concept is achieved by ````==```` sign but if you want strict equality comparision then you have to use ````===```` sign. Similarly, we can guess what is the meaning of ````!=```` and ````!==```` operators in JS.
``<= `` operator also converts the type at first go!
Case values in switch case are checked with strictly unequal.
    ```
    switch(case){
    case case_1:do_something; break;
    .
    .
    .
    default:
    do_something;
    break;
    }
    ```

Really upset that I was not able to complete the first module. It is insanely simple and I am really feeling that I am wasting time learning it but it's cool. Enough of today. Can somehow call it a day.

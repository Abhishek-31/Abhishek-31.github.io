``` This is my Fourth Day of ML course ```


Found the motivation to work consistently.For today there are no goals. I'll try to complete till fourth week.

So finally I can say that I quit coding for a time and also that till the deadlines of this course are met, I'll not touch CP or any other sort of code. Just ML course will be completed.
Solving CP problems is time consuming and is an engaging activity. 
I am keeping L course as a priority right now. I can't delay working on it.

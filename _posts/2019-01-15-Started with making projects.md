####Project Enthusiast
I realised that by making projects is the only way that I can master any skill. I really love project making and the journey it takes by making you learn various concepts.

Okay so I have my class at 1:30pm. Can't understand what is happening to our college-no classes, no fun, just those boring days are passing. I realise we had more fun in my school days but now enough of it. Beginning to make projects.

Now, a lot of html-css happening these days so now machine-learning will be done.
Started with revision.

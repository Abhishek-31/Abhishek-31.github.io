So, all this time I wandered from here and there from various topics because I was preparing for my Internship. I got two internship opportunities from Adobe and UHG. I was celebrating this fact from the last two months and now it is the time to again get my hands dirty by coding. So enough time has passed and I have not actually worked with Javascript and node.js and whenever I watched projects, I wanted to understand them line by line so as to make it from scratch. Well, I have planned to again start backend development. Not basically frontend, but backend and try to complete it once. I have planned to complete this revision by January 26. So let's check whether it is possible or not. Maybe the reason behind my inability to learn things like they should be is my delayed plans due to procrastination. You know, you have to begin at sometime. Enough of lectures. Getting back to work. :P
The following would be my track:

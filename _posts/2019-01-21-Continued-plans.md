### Plans and failures

I don't know how to manage situations where I have multiple opportunities. I have to learn to let things go as simply as they were meant to pass. Drafted all ideas allotted and started with javascript freecodecamp. I have to practice about it a lot so as to be good in it. Only then could I write my specialisation in javascript.

`` backticks as they are called are used for multiline string including next line. Also ${object.property} is used foe inserting the value of that paticular property at that position.

Started reading about various syntatic sugar provided by javascript.

In Ecma 5 while adding a function inside an object, you have to use a keyword function like a:function(b){};
in ECMA 6 you can use directly as a(b){return}.

Despite wasting a lot of time on youtube, now resuming with Machine-Learning. Some of the lectures and some of the quizes were left which needs to be completed so as to get the certifications.

This week will be devoted to those certificates.

Started with Javascript and today will be completing first module of javascript on freecodecamp.
I read that while you are making a loop you should decrement as decrementing is faster than incrementing. What the heck is this :P

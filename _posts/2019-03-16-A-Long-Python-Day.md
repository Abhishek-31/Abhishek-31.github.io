So as officially numpy etc. were covered, I saw many concepts that were new to me and at many places I felt the need of completing python from a book. So I have this book Python in 24 Hours and I think, this is the best time when I should learn Python and that too quickly. 
So lets give it a start:
For input you have to use. ```str(input())```
For printing you can use + sign in between print. Suppose, ```print("Abhishek"+"Agarwal")```
This + can be used to add strings in orfer to concatenate.
Obviously you cannot add an integer and a string.
The following are the numeric types in python
Int,
Float,
Complex,
'e' is used to indicate power of 10.
